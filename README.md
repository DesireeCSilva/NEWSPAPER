# TECHTODAY 
This project is a proposal of a sustainable development of a news management web application. Our website have a low-consumption design, using dark mode with a monotone palette of colours, system fonts that are already loaded on all the devices and images in webp format to reduce their weight. The user flow is easy and intuitive, and we have taken into account the UX without barriers avoiding pop-up banners and using dark patterns. We have also not included videos or animations to optimize the loading time of the website.
